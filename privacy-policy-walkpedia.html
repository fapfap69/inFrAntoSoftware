    <h1>Privacy Policy for Walkpedia</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 11, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> Walkpedia uses your device's GPS location to identify street names and provide historical information. This location data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or third parties.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Settings and Preferences:</strong> The app stores your preferences (language, text length, search frequency) locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your location data is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the street you are currently on</li>
        <li>Fetch relevant historical information from Wikipedia</li>
        <li>Provide text-to-speech functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not store, transmit, or share your location data with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Wikipedia API:</strong> We query Wikipedia's public API to retrieve historical information. No personal data is sent with these requests.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Google AI (Optional):</strong> When Wikipedia doesn't have information, we may use Google's Gemini API as a fallback. Only the street name is sent to Google, never your location or personal data.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device. We do not maintain servers or databases that store user information. When you delete the app, all associated data is permanently removed.</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p><strong>Location Permission:</strong> Required to identify street names. You can revoke this permission at any time in iOS Settings, but the app will not function without it.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Walkpedia does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is designed to be educational and safe for all ages.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
